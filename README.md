## Electric Vehicles Trend Analysis in the USA (2010 - Jan 2024)

## Overview

Electric vehicles (EVs) are spearheading a transformative shift in the automotive industry, revolutionizing the way we commute and drastically altering our environmental impact. With the pressing need to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions, EVs emerge as a crucial solution, offering unparalleled benefits to the environment.

In this Power BI project, we analyze the usage and trends of electric vehicles in the United States from 2010 to January 2024. Utilizing multiple visualization graphs and filter tools from Microsoft Power BI, we draw in-depth insights into the EV market.

## Objective

1. **Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles**, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. **Determine the average electric range** of the vehicles in the dataset to gauge technological advancements and efficiency.
3. **Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** in the dataset.
4. **Calculate the percentage of BEVs** relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
5. **Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)** in the dataset.
6. **Calculate the percentage of PHEVs** relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
